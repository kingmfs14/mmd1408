        <p>This is what my car stereo looks like. Pretty confusing if you can't read the fine print and before playing with it for a while.</p>
        <img src="img/og-wire.jpg" alt="Wireframe of Stereo">
        <p>Created a wireframe of the current layout of the stereo to better assist with adjustments</p>
        <img src="img/mod-1.jpg" alt="1 Modification of Stereo">
        <p>Modified the layout by combining the clock and display button. Removed the second dial, while adding an up and down button for navigation. Created FM/AM buttons. Wanted to give it a standard stereo look.</p>
        <img src="img/mod-2.jpg" alt="2 Modification of Stereo">
        <p>Move all of the navigation button controls to one central location on the left. Removed the up and down buttons by adding the arrows for menu, cd, and radio navigation. I left the number buttons since they make moving between stations easy.</p>
